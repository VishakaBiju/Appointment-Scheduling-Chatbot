Google Sheet Database Information

This project uses Google Sheets as a lightweight database to store appointment records.

Sheet Name: doctors_database
Tab: slot (or appointments)

Columns:
1. Doctor
2. Date
3. Time
4. Phone
5. Status (Booked / Cancelled)

Usage:
- When a user books or cancels an appointment, the chatbot updates this sheet.
- Old appointments (past dates) are automatically removed using an Apps Script that runs daily.
- The sheet acts as a persistent backend storage for all appointment-related data.

Integration Steps:
- The Flask backend uses the Google Sheets API to read/write appointment details.
- The sheet link can be made viewable to testers if needed (without editing rights).
